# Trading Cards UI – Erent Inc.

This project contains the **Trading Cards UI** developed as part of my work at **Erent Inc.**.  
The UI was built using the **uni-app** framework and is designed for the **Erent Platform**, where trading cards can be viewed, rented, and tokenized as NFTs.

## Features

- Get Started landing screen with animated visuals and custom button interactions
- Detailed card view with chart, price history, and property metadata
- Custom-designed mobile-first layout with blur, gradient, and modern glassmorphism styles

## Tech Stack

- [HBuilderX](https://www.dcloud.io/hbuilderx.html) + uni-app
- Vue 2
- Canvas API for chart rendering
- Scoped CSS for full custom UI design
